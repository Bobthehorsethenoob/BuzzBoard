# BuzzBoard
 The purpose of BuzzBoard is to have students be able to join clubs, interact with members, and be notified of announcements and upcoming events. Also to have club owners be able to manage clubs, announcements, events, and members. The goal is to make the process for each action to be seamless and user friendly. A problem that BuzzBoard aims to solve for students is the lack of information surrounding clubs and events. For club owners, the problem to be solved is the management of clubs and events.
